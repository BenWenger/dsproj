To build:
    make all

To run treelist test program (which tests to make sure my TreeList class
operates as intended):
    ./tester
    
To run the scheduler:
    ./scheduler <num_procs>
    
    If <num_procs> is not provided, the program will default to using
    5 processors (I know this is not realistic -- I just chose it
    arbitrarily)
    
    
Instructions for how to use the scheduler are printed when you start it.
